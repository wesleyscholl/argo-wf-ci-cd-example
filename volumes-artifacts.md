### Artifacts and Volumes: Core Differences

| **Storage Medium** | **Purpose and Functionality**                                                                          | **Scope of Data Sharing**                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Volumes**        | Shared storage mechanism for data exchange between containers within the same pod                      | Primarily for short-lived, immediate data sharing within a single workflow execution                             |
| **Artifacts**      | Flexible data transfer mechanism across different workflow steps, potentially across pods and clusters | Support persistent storage, versioning, and can be used for caching and transferring data between workflow steps |

| **Best For**               | Immediate data sharing within a single pod                                           | Transferring data between workflow steps                                                                  |
|                            | Temporary file system needs                                                          | Persistent storage and retrieval                                                                          |
|                            | Lightweight, quick data exchange                                                     | Caching build outputs                                                                                     |

| **Challenges/Limitations** | Data exists only during the pod lifecycle                                            | Transfer latency: Large artifacts (e.g., multi-gigabyte datasets) must be fully transferred between steps |
|                            | Cannot easily transfer between different pods                                        | Can increase workflow execution time, create bandwidth constraints, and risk timeouts for large files     |
|                            | No built-in versioning or archiving                                                  | Storage backend complexity: Relies on external systems like S3                                            |
|                            | Disk space constraints: Limited by the node's storage capacity                       | Requires additional configuration, authentication, and infrastructure management                          |
|                            | Scaling issues: Inefficient for workflows with high data transfer needs across steps | Performance may vary depending on storage provider                                                        |
